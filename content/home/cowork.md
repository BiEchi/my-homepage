I’ve got some interesting ideas that’s promising but I currently lack bandwidth to work on. If you’re interested in working with me, send an application email to me indicating your interests and previous work.  Due to a large amount of applications, I can only interview UIUC CS students (either undergrad or grad) for this semester. Please indicate whether you’ve got experience/knowledge in the fields below:

**Expected (mainly for Undergrad students)**

-   Convex Optimization. (good sense)
-   Self-attention and Transformers. (very solid)
-   LLMs: Insights and Trends. (very solid)

**Preferred (mainly for Grad students)**

-   Game Theory.
-   Information Theory.
-   Random Process.
