I’ve got some interesting ideas that’s promising but I currently lack bandwidth to work on. If you’re interested in working with me, send an application to me with your CV indicating your interests and previous work. Given my current bandwidth, I can only interview UIUC CS students (either undergrad or grad) for this semester. Please indicate whether you’ve got experience/knowledge in the fields below:

**Expected (mainly for Undergrad students)**

-   Convex Optimization. (good sense)
-   Self-attention and Transformers. (very solid)
-   LLMs: Insights and Trends. (very solid)

**Preferred (mainly for Grad students)**

-   Game Theory.
-   Information Theory.
-   Model interpretability.
-   Random Process.
-   Neuroscience.

No restrictions on publications. If you published a paper at NIPS or TPAMI please mentor me ;p
