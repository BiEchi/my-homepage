This summer research internship focused on developing a transformer-oriented accelerator SoC based on the the Gemmini architecture using the Chipyard en- vironment. Learned to use Chisel/Scala HDL to program on hardware, Spike for simulation, C for building model framework, Docker as the working environment and Git as the version control system.
