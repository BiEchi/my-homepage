Learning resources of linear algebra are notoriously known for their abstract de- scription of concepts and disconnection from engineering applications. This re- search aims to synthesize an engineering-oriented learning routine of linear alge- bra with both statistic and geometric views. The paper is written still following the traditional learning routine of linear algebra, but each concept in linear alge- bra is explained in an applicable way.
