During the career of teaching assistant of ECE 220, I modified the GoAutoGrader program by Wenqing Luo on the server, which gives instant feedbacks and reference score to code assignments submitted. Extracted the program to a general Golang application that pulls code to the server for subsequent tasks whenever there is a GitHub submission, and queue the tasks with parallelization.
