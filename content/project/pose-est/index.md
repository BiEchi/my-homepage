As the dataset Human3.6M is single-object, this research aims to enhance this dataset by duplicating objects on the same plane with shifts, rotation, collision elimination, and disturbed camera movement. I implemented the collision elimi- nation part by modeling objects as 2D boxes so that no boxes have overlap with each other.

The paper for this project is not yet available, and will be available after publication to HP3C 2022. I'm also considering making a speech on the meeting.
