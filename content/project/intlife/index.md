Project IntLife aims to develop a forum for on-campus ZJUI college students to connect to each other, like making appointments, resaling goods, lost-and-found, etc. I was in charge of message list development, where I used cloud database for back-end and cloud functions for queries. The group chat functionality will be the CS 411 Project.
