Because code editing on a website does not offer good experience, this project aims to let students code in VS Code and use the extension to push the code onto the code editing website, which has received more than 200 downloads in the Marketplace. The paper of this project also introduces that this framework can be applied to almost all similar demands, and I won the best oral speaker prize in the Conference ICFTIC.
