As the dataset Human3.6M is single-object, this research aims to enhance this dataset by duplicating objects on the same plane with shifts, rotation, collision elimination, and disturbed camera movement. I implemented the collision elimi- nation part by modeling objects as 2D boxes so that no boxes have overlap with each other.
