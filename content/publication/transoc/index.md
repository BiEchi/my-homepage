abstract: 'Nowadays, transformer is a very popular deep learning model in both fields of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. With very large number of parameters in the model, trans- former usually takes a significant amount of time for training and inference. Recent researches have been done to solve similar problems based on the Berkeleyâ€™s systolic array generator called Gemmini architecture, and made great progress using this method. Thus, we follow this pat- tern and build a transformer accelerator based on the Gemmini architecture, which is mostly a matrix multiplication accelerator based on the systolic array technique. We developed the trans- former testing framework for the Gemmini project with results. Additionally, we also provide our analysis for the Gemmini hardware and possible ways to implement the transformer accelerator.'
