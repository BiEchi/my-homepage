abstract: 'Chatbots are often hindered by the latency associated with integrating real-time web search results, compromising user experience. To
overcome this, we present CharmBana, an innovative social chatbot
that introduces the use of progressive response generation to effortlessly blend search results into the botâ€™s responses, while ensuring
low response latency. The use of progressive responses is especially beneficial for voice-based chatbots, where the preliminary
response buys time for a detailed follow-up, ensuring a smooth
user interaction. As a result, our method not only cuts down user
waiting times by 50% but also generates more relevant, precise, and
engaging search inquiries. When tested in the Alexa Prize Socialbot
Grand Challenge 5 , our chatbot employing progressive responses
consistently received higher user ratings.'
