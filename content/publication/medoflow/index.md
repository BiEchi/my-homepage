abstract: 'MedoFlow utilizes Python as the framework frontend and TVM as the framework backend. The frontend implements the computational graph, auto gradient calculation (autograd) system, shape inference system, and operator abstractions. The backend implements the TVM implementation of a vari- ety of operators such as Matrix Multiplication (MatMul), Convolutional-2D (Conv2D) and Max Pooling-2D (Maxpool2D), to facilitate parallel computa- tion on a set of compilers such as LLVM and CUDA. This framework facili- tates to implement complex applications such as LeNet-5 and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). To illustrate MedoFlow is comparable to mainstream frameworks, this work conducts comprehensive experiments on a variety of models like Multi- layer Perceptron (MLP), LeNet-5 and RNN using PyTorch, TensorFlow and MedoFlow to compare their accuracy and time efficiency. Experimental re- sults show that MedoFlow reaches the same level of accuracy as the other frameworks, and its time efficiency can be significantly improved by im- plementing small TVM optimizations. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/BiEchi/MedoFlow.'
