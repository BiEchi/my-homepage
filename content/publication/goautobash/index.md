abstract: "Recently, more and more server tasks are done using full automation, including grading tasks for students in the college courses, integrating tasks for programmers in big projects and server-based transactions, and visualization tasks for researchers in a data-dense topic. Using automation on servers provides a great possibility for reducing the burden on manual tasks. Although server tools like CI/CD for continuous integration and Hexo for automated blog deployment have been developed, they're highly dedicated to certain functionalities and thus lack general usage. In this paper, we introduce a Golang-based automation framework that reacts to the events happening on GitHub in a multi-thread approach. This framework utilizes a queue to arrange the tasks submitted and execute each task with a thread in a preemptive manner. We then use the project GoAutoGrader to illustrate a specific implementation of this framework and its value in implementing high-freedom server applications. As Golang is developing in a rapid way because of its incredible parallel programming efficiency and a super-easy way to learn on the basis of C-like programming languages, we decide to develop this system in Golang."
