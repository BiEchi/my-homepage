Hi, there! I'm Jack. I'm an M.S. student in Computer Science at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I’m fortunate to be advised by Prof. Heng Ji. The core of my research lies broadly in **how modern language models understands knowledge**. I work on this problem upon two tracks:

- ML: from the bottom up, I study **latent representations** learned by modern language models, especially causal attention. I try to connect to classical theories to **understand & interpret** what and how the models are learning. This track naturally involves large-scale pre-training and dictionary learning.
- NLP: From the top down, I apply these inspirations and findings to NLP tasks like question-answering and information retrieval.

**Bio:** Jack Bai is an M.S. student in Computer Science at UIUC, working on structured **information retrieval** in the Blender Lab with Prof. [Heng Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=z7GCqT4AAAAJ). He is also a research intern of the BAIR Lab, working on **representation learning** with Prof. [Yi Ma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=XqLiBQMAAAAJ). Before master's, he obtained a dual degree from Zhejiang University and UIUC in Computer Engineering, during which period he interned at Microsoft Research working on **incident text root cause prediction** with Dr. [Shilin He](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=wECvv2UAAAAJ), and participated in the [Alexa ChatBot Challenge](https://www.amazon.science/alexa-prize/teams/charmana-2022) researching **search query generation**, advised by Prof. [Chengxiang Zhai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=YU-baPIAAAAJ). Except experience mentioned above, his work also reflects interests in financial time series prediction, open-domain QA, software frameworks for deep learning, etc.
