Hi, there! I'm **Jack**. I'm an M.S. student in Computer Science at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, with great honor to be advised by Prof. Heng Ji. At the core of my research in usable and reliable intelligence, I strive to equip machines with **multi-modal** and **up-to-date** knowledge using **explainable** methods. The ultimate aim of my research is to promote **interpretability and truthfulness** in information access and generation, through a variety of explainable methods with low bias, easy evaluation methods and high computational efficiency.

**Bio:** Jack Bai is an M.S. **research assistant** in **Computer Science** at UIUC, working on multi-modal information retrieval in the **Blender Lab** with Prof. [Heng Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=z7GCqT4AAAAJ) and Prof. [Chengxiang Zhai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=YU-baPIAAAAJ). He is also a **research intern** of the **Berkeley AI Research** (BAIR) Lab, working on multi-modal white-box Transformer models with Prof. [Yi Ma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=XqLiBQMAAAAJ). Before master's, he obtained a dual degree from Zhejiang University and UIUC in **Computer Engineering**. He was a research intern at Microsoft Research, working on **incident root cause prediction** using LM with Dr. [Shilin He](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=wECvv2UAAAAJ), and a member of the UIUC Alexa ChatBot team researching **Internet search query generation**. He was also a research intern working on **distributed LM training** with Prof. [Volodymyr Kindtatenko](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=Cy81VegAAAAJ) at NCSA. Except experience mentioned above, his work also reflects interests in financial time series prediction, open-domain QA, software frameworks for deep learning, etc.
