Jack Bai is a senior Computer Engineering student at Zhejiang University (ZJ, China) and UIUC (IL, USA). He was a research intern with Prof. Heng Ji at Blender Lab, UIUC, and a research intern with Prof. Volodymyr Kindtatenko and Prof. Jooyoung Seo at NCSA, UIUC. He has a wide research topic in gradient-based methods, including NLP, CV, Frameworks, and Quantitative Finance. He studied (NLP) task-oriented dialog systems, code generation models, (CV) multi-object tracking, surface registration, fine-grained instance segmentation and (Framework) distributed deep learning frameworks. He is currently (NLP) researching on open-domain question answering and (Quants) earning Certificate in Quantitative Finance (CQF). He is the contracted individual author of the book (Framework) *Modern Deep Learning Frameworks: A Top-down Approach* with Tsinghua University Press and Springer. He is an open-source developer who implemented language servers and Selenium-based automation tools for VS Code. He is the founder of *Hepta Web Engineering* and *HeptaAI Lab* clubs. He plan to study more about reinforcement learning and follow the hierarchical AGI approach proposed by Yann LeCun in the paper *A Path Towards Autonomous Machine Intelligence* in his master/PhD degree.
