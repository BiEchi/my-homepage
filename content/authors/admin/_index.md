Jack Bai is a junior student receiving two Computer Engineering degrees, at Zhejiang University, China and UIUC, USA. He is currently a researcher on prompt tuning for few-shot learning and continuous learning in dialog system. He is also interested in object detection, especially in a fine-grained and dense scenario. He finished rudimental researches on distributed deep learning frameworks, action-oriented pose estimation, and image registration in SLAM. He is an open-source developer who implemented extensions for VS Code, applications for iOS and Android, and chatbots for Telegram, Discord, Slack, etc. He is interested in computer networking and he started Hepta Workshop that focuses on web engineering.
