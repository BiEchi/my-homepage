# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Sandeep is an experienced Research Software Engineer with a demonstrated history of working in multiple research areas. Skilled in Computer Vision and Image Analysis. Strong engineering professional with a Master of Science in Computer Science and Engineering from the University at Buffalo. He helped me with a networking bug in FastAPI when I was doing the Professor Medo Project. He provided me an insight of the asynchronization issues, that the server frameworks are already well-built and we'd better expect bugs showing in other places.
